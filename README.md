Simple floating system info for *nix (might work on windows, idk)

## To use the build script (for arch, you'll need to edit it for debian)
```
npm i -g electron-packager electron-installer-debian
yay -S debtap
```

### You can edit your settings in ~/.floatinfo

Disclaimer: this was my first time using electron (and node) so
